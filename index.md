# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about collaborating on a ASP .NET / Visual Studio C# / SQL project for the HR Department and IT Department of my employer, as well as an employee portal where employees can look up profiles of co-workers and obtain info such as e-mail address and contact phone number and department, etc.
